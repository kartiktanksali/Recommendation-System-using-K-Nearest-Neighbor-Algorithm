This program uses K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

The program doesn't use any kind of inbuilt library to apply KNN Algorithm.

The recommendation system makes a User-to-User based filtering.

It first calculates the person correlation values from the ratings given by the users.

Converts those values into weighted averages and sorts it out in descending order to provide the recommendation.

In the CollabrativeFilteringUBF.py file we have requested for k=1 & k=3 i.e number of nearest neighbors.

You can changes it in the above mentioned file.
